# Visual Bell for Hyper

I just missed a good old visual bell (mostly because I tend to work with the sound muted)

### Installation
1. Open Hyper's preferences by pressing `Cmd + ,`
2. Find and Update the plugins array to include `hyper-visual-bell`:  

  ```js
  plugins: [
    'hyper-visual-bell'  
  ],
  ```

3. Reload Hyper by pressing `Cmd + Shft + R`
